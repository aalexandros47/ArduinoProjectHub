# Arduino Project Hub

Welcome to Arduino Project Hub, a dedicated repository where I share a variety of Arduino projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project is documented with code, schematics, and a detailed walkthrough to help you understand and replicate the projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
# Example for installing the Arduino IDE
